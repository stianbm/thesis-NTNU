\section{Requirements}
    % List and explain the requirements from the specialisation project.
    In the specialisation project leading up to this master's thesis, functional and non-functional requirements were identified. They have been slightly improved in this master's thesis to be clearer and more specific, and one new non-functional requirement (\textbf{nFR6}) have been added explicitly.

\section{Minimal Viable Product}
    % A prioritised list of features to be implemented. The first points are regarded as minimum to be completed. Create the list together with domain experts and supervisor.
    The development technique for creating the new Oppdal Application is the Minimal Viable Product (MVP) approach. Techopedia\cite{techopedia} defines this at the technique where a product is developed containing the bare minimum functionality. Then, more features are added, typically through feedback produced by the MVP. This technique has two major benefits for this master's thesis. Firstly, it allows users to be included as early as possible in order to better guide the product from an early part of the development when changes are less cumbersome to make. Secondly, it allows for more dynamic planning, as the developer is less experienced in the tools and frameworks necessary to develop the application. This is likely to result in less time used for planning and re-planning due to the uncertainty in time estimates. The plan for the MVP is a prioritised list as can be seen below. The line separates the ''must-have'' features of the MVP from the ''if-time'' features that can be added.

    As explained more in detail in the Specialisation Project\cite{specialisation}, the topology has been recreated from LiDAR scanning of the area, publicly available at Kartverket\cite{hoydedata}. The complete pipeline for creating a usable model for the ground without sacrificing too much performance is a long and iterative one. In order to get an overview of the process, as well as details and reasoning, the entire pipeline is presented as a numbered list in \cref{tab:pipeline}, followed by sections detailing the steps. The numbered list also contains a column showing which software or service is used in each step.

    \subsection{Acquire Point Cloud from Kartverket}
        The first step of creating the ground model is to acquire the LiDAR scanning of the area. The scanning is openly available at the Norwegian Mapping Authority - Kartverket. On their web pages, the area in question can be marked and the data files will be made available at a custom link address. Depending on the size of the area, the data will typically be divided into several \texttt{.laz} files.
        
        It could also be possible to get terrain models directly from Kartverket. One would then have to find software to open the model files (\texttt{geoTiff}) and find another way to filer out the vegetation.
    
    \subsection{Filter with LasTools}
        LasTools\cite{lastools} is a semi-open source software developed by rapidlasso. It has several functions to work on point cloud data, where some are completely open source, and others are free to use for non-commercial projects.
        
        With the \texttt{.laz} files available, the most practical thing is to merge the files into one. Afterwards, the terrain can be filtered from the vegetation using one of the only-for-non-commercial functions: \texttt{lasground\_new.exe}. Finally, the point cloud can be exported as a \texttt{.txt} file that Meshlab can read.
    
    \subsection{Reconstruct Surface with Meshlab}
        The software used for the surface recreation is Meshlab\cite{LocalChapterEvents:ItalChap:ItalianChapConf2008:129-136}. It is open source and made for working with large point clouds and models, as well as supporting mesh reconstruction. Although it could be a good idea to reduce the size of the point cloud, the model contains a walkway in the valley that is important to keep as precise as possible.

        \end{figure}
        \FloatBarrier
        
        Screened Poisson Surface Reconstruction\cite{kazhdan2013screened} was used to recreate the ground model from the point cloud. It relies on the points having normals, so these normals had to be calculated first. The reconstructing algorithm was tested with different reconstructing depths where the choice landed on 12. This resulted in longer computing time but a very good reconstruction quality. The model was also cleaned for duplicate edges and vertices without normals.
        
        Because the ground model is constructed from points, and the points have gps coordinates, the resulting model has a very large offset from its local origin. Although a better practise would be to keep these coordinates, as they could be useful information later, they made it hard to locate the model in programs like Blender. Therefore the origin of the model was reset to approximately the centre of the geometry. The model was exported as a \texttt{.ply} file as it can be read by both Blender and Meshlab and has good compression.
    
    \subsection{Cut Model in Blender}
        Blender\cite{blender} is a versatile, open source software with many different features. It was used to further rework and texture the model where Meshlab proved less appropriate. It was first used to partition the model into three smaller areas that would be simplified at different rates. This partitioning can be seen in \cref{fig:model_original}. The reasoning behind the partition is to cut the model into the part that the player will move on, the are they will look at most, and the part they are only supposed to view at a distance or not at all. This will also allow parts of the model to be worked on in isolation from the rest.

    \subsection{Simplify Model in Meshlab}
        With the model divided into different parts, they can be simplified tailored to their importance. The Quadratic Edge Collapse Decimation algorithm was used to achieve this. This simplification allows to preserve the general topology, as well as the edges of the final model. This is important as the different parts of the model need to fit together at the end. The simplification was controlled by stating the percentage of vertices that should survive. Different percentages was tested for the ground models, to trade off quality against file size. As the models had a very high vertex count, the walkway was scaled to 15 \% of original vertex count, the main area was set to 2 \% and the rest were set to 0.1 \%.
        
        \todo{Input image of post-simplification}
    
    \subsection{Rework and Texture Model in Blender}
        Although the recreation of the walkway was successful, the omnidirectional treadmill needs more space than a person would normally need. This is because it is less precise than actual walking, as well as a little harder to control. To accommodate this the walkway was reworked in Blender to provide a flatter surface for the players. When the three ground models were ready, they were textured using a satellite image from Google Maps. Finally the ground models were exported as \texttt{.fbx} files, as Unity does not support the \texttt{.ply} format.
